# Prerequisites

Immediately after your introduction add a section titled listing any prerequisite knowledge or tools anyone who wants to use the project might need before they begin. For example, if it runs on the latest version of Python, tell them to install Python. Here's an example:

# How to install the thing

Provide installation steps! It's amazing how many projects I've come across that only provide basic usage instructions and expect you to magically know how to install it. Make sure to break the installation down into numbered steps if it requires multiple steps.

# Steps for how to use the project once the user has installed it.

Make sure to include usage examples and a reference explaining command options or flags if you think they will be helpful. If you have more advanced documentation in a separate file or site, link to this from here.

# How to contribute to the thing

Provide steps for contributing to the project. Alternatively you might want to create a contributor's guide in a separate file and link to this from your README if you want people to read it before contributing pull requests to your project.

# Add contributors

Credit any contributors who have helped with the project in an author section. It's a nice way to make open source feel like a team effort and acknowledges everyone who has taken the time to contribute.

# Add acknowledgements

Similarly, if you have used anyone else's work (code, designs, images etc) that has a copyright that requires acknowledgement, you might want to add that here. You can also acknowledge any other developers or institutions who helped with the project.

# Contact information

You might not want to do this is you're an extremely private person but if someone has questions, wants to collaborate with you or is impressed enough with your project to offer you a job opportunity, it makes sense to have your contact details front and centre.

# Add licence information

You definitely want to include licence information if applicable. Startups and other companies who rely on third-party software are unlikely to be able to use your project unless you provide this. Check out choosealicense.com or opensource.org for a list of licences you may be able to use.
